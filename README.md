list of records
address is calculated using & and converted from integer to character string.
hash is generated by adding a number between 0 to 100 to base value of 10000.
hash value and owner id are distinct values hence checked within tree through inorder traversal if value already exists then function called again.
a tree of records is created.
the root node named gen.
display data function uses structure and displays the data.
the root node is initialized with a large number so that many child nodes can be accomodated
owner id of node is initiallized to 100 and incremented by 1 every time a new node is added.
